			<h1>Intellectually Competent</h1>
		</div>
		<p>I am not a quiet person, but I was very quiet as a freshman.</p>
		<p>I was in a new environment, and no where near confident.</p>
		<p>I didn't want to be labeled and have that label stick with me for four years. I wanted to create myself, so I would be liked and respected by all.</p>
		<p>Every year I became more comfortable with who I was, and in return more confident.</p>

			<p>Conquering the slopes with Austin, Alan, Nate, and Declan was epic.</p>
			<p>You won't find more bad ass skiers, (and snowboarder) on any mountain. Michael and Jacob are pretty bad ass too ;)</p>

			<p>I showed up to class the day of the parade. Regis had already given us an early dismissal, but no one was at school! I was one of four people in first period! I left right when second started and headed downtown to join the millions of people attending the parade.</p>
			<p>It was a happy day, Jacob was accepted to CU, and I got to be with my best friends, and see the best football team in the world.</p>

		<p>One of the greatest opportunities God has blessed me with is coding.</p>

		<img src="images/competence/code.jpg" alt="Jason Lewis and Tommy Gaessler">

		<p>When I was a junior, I had no idea I would learn so much about coding the next year. And certainly the thought of making websites for four figures never crossed my mind.</p>

		<p>I was able to connect my love of coding with my love of instagram by making my first app! Check it out!</p>
