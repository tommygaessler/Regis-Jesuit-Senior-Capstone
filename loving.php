			<h1>Loving</h1>

		<!-- <p>I hadn't felt love in a very long time until Kairos. When my moms letter was read aloud, I was filled with tears. Those tears did not stop until long after I read the letters waiting for me on my bed in our cabin.</p>

		<blockquote><p><i>"It was amazing to see the upperclassmen that I looked up to, cheering for me when we stormed through the chapel."</i></p></blockquote>

		<p>That feeling of love on Kairos made me want to help others feel the same way. I would put writing letters before homework. I hoped time would speed by, so I could write letters to my Regis brothers and sisters so they would feel loved.</p>

		<p>This is Regis, and this is what makes it special.</p>

She always remembers my birthday, sends me gifts all the way from Chicago, and even shipped me my tripod when I left it at her house! She is so artistic, and has the cutest dog named Plato! I would not be at Regis if it weren't for her, and I am eternally grateful for her giving me the opportunity to be educated by the Jesuits just like she was! Love you Grams!</p>

		<p>A brother I learned to love with all my heart was Michael Gaessler. Regis brought us together. The long car rides to and from where ever our journey was taking us meant so much to me. I loved listening to all kinds of music, and talking about the world and our dreams! Thanks for being the best little brother I never asked for!</p>

		<p>This year at my service site I learned how loving you have to be with babies!</p>
