			<h1>Open to Growth</h1>
		</div>

		<p>Four years is a long time. I knew that when I stepped up the first step on the first day of school. What I didn't know was that I would take my last step on the last day of school, as a completely different man.</p>

		<p>1 other person from my school was going to Regis, and she was a girl, so I knew I would not see her much. I also knew some kids through baseball, and met the rest over the summer playing for the Regis. So I was not completely alone. Soon I realized I had gone to kindergarten - 3rd with about 20 kids at Regis. I was shocked! Its funny how you get reconnected with people down the road! Freshman year I made the sophomore baseball team, we were really really good. I also realized how incredible it was having so much support from the upperclassmen.</p>

		<p>Here is a photo I took of the Pre-AC! I love the PAC, I would go there everyday with my friends for cookie time and lunch.</p>

		<img src="images/growth/preac.jpg" alt="Picture before the Pac was built">

		<p>The highlight of the year was when I went to Florida for spring break. My cousins rented a house on St. George Island. I hadn't been to the beach in 10+ years, and hadn't seen my cousins in 5 years! We had a great time!</p>

			<p id="space">I became best friends with Chris Ireland. We would do everything together including trips to California! We always competed in anything we did. I always won, except once, when he got a more expensive speeding ticket then me. Chris always drove. If I was with Chris, and we had to drive somewhere, he drove. Ive driven more in his car, then my own! Chris is the best, fastest, craziest driver I have ever riden with. I trust him with my life 110%.</p>

			<p>Not to mention I had the coolest carpool ever. I either drove to school in the biggest red truck I've ever seen, a black Cadillac Escalde, or a gray Range Rover. He only forgot me once, and he had Quinn VandeKoppel sub in for him a few times when he skipped first period. I can't say I trust Terran with my life 110%, but I do trust his truck. We crashed into Quinn and his other friend on parker one snowy day 3 minutes away from Regis. The two cars we hit were totaled, but Terran's truck barly had a scratch.</p>

		<p>I started to feel trapped. I wanted to do something. So I started a business. I looked at potential markets to be in. I came to a conclusion. Most of my time was spent in school, and everyone at school had to follow a dress code. The next thing I knew, I was in the belt business!</p>

		<p>I ordered belts in bulk from China. 100 to be exact, and it cost me less then a dollar for each belt. I figured I would sell each belt for $10. My margins were great! But not my sales! I did more then break even, but I learned a very important lesson about my business. It was very hard to sell shitty belts from China to rich kids!</p>

		<p>I still have belts under my bed to this day! I ditched the clothing business and thought of something else I could do to make money.</p>

		<img src="images/growth/belt.jpg" alt="Rainbow of belts">

		<p>At the end of my junior year, I applied for two jobs. Wait, what I really mean to say is that my dad made me apply for two jobs.</p>

		<p>I got both. I was a teacher at a summer camp helping kids learn computer science by day, and a bus boy at Maggianos by night. I made a great deal of money.</p>

	<div class="row">

		<p>The summer only lasts for so long, and I quit my job at Maggianos after I got promoted. I went back to the drawing board once again.</p>

		<p>I always loved technology, and was good with computers. I took every class at Regis related to coding and computers, but I was never challenged enough. Next thing I knew I was taking classes four days a week after school at Galvanize. I learned how to make professional looking websites, use API's, build little web applications, and integrate WordPress in my sites! I was ready to make money!</p>

		<p>My first client, and all my clients so far have come to me. Mr. Katz walked in to my broadcasting class one day asking for videos for his new non-profit Suit Up Denver. I asked if he had a website and <a href="http://suitupdenver.org/" target="blank">suitupdenver.org</a> was born. A partnership and friendship was also born. Jason Lewis and I bonded immediately, we talked about entrepreneurship, shared the same dreams, and oh, worked incredibly well together. But we hadn't quite put the two pieces together.</p>

		<p>I was helping my moms coworker on her existing website, and I happened to show them Suit Up Denver. 20 minutes later I got Jason on the phone and said, "I just got you a job." We sold them on a completely new website, with videos to go along with it. The light bulb went off, our web design and video/media consulting company was born! I was finally my own boss!</p>

		<p>I could not have grown as a man without Regis. Regis taught me how to act in certain situations, and matured me into a confident man. Without Regis I would have never met Mr. Katz, never met Jason, and never landed my first client that would skyrocket my web design business.</p>

		<img src="images/growth/look.jpg" alt="Tommy Gaessler free from the woods">

		<p>Regis dances are only fun if the music is good, and if you go with the right person. Not only did I get to go to Regis homecoming with the most amazing girl in the world, I got to go to her homecoming in California as well. It was a dream come true.</p>

Apart from the four years of life college steals from you, and the debt that weighs you down, I knew college was not for me when I started spending time at Galvanize freshman year. With tech jobs so in demand, it is a much better investment to learn how to code at a coding boot camp. The Galvanize Full Stack Web Developer program is 6 months long, a fraction of the cost it would take to go to college, and has a 97% job placement rate. The skills I will learn in 6 months, and the 3 years of real world job experience, will destroy any student fresh out of college with a traditional 4 year computer science degree.</p>

My Grandmother makes the best pancakes in the world, I wish I could always wake up to her love and the delicious mickey mouse pancakes everyday! My Granddaddy is the toughest and coolest guy I know!

		<p class="no-margin-top">Mrs. Hogan, and Mrs. Hayton helped me so much with my learning services. I would not be graduating if it weren't for them. Mrs. Hogan helped me get extended timing on the ACT which increased my score greatly. Mrs. Hayton would also chat with me, let me take tests in her office, reach out and see how I was doing, and always share her candy! Thank you both for being so understanding with my dysgraphia, and dyslexia.</p>

		<p>Mr. Heidenry also deserves my appreciation. Even though we don't agree on everything, (javascript is better then Java), he guided me (in Java, boooo), on how to tackle my javascript take home challenge when I applied to Galvanize Full Stack!</p>

		<p>I am so thankful for my three Galvanize instructors. Matthew Leach, my first teacher at Galvanize, was so supportive, the nicest person I've ever met, and he really knew how to make coding super fun! Jenny Allar, my javascript teacher was so fun and nice, I looked forward to nothing more except this class during my Regis school day! Lastly, my WordPress and advance web design teacher Chris Holder always wore Patagonia, and never went anywhere with his beanie or hat. I never saw his hair. He also said some pretty funny, but weird stuff. Here is one of 100 quotes I recorded from him:</p>

		<blockquote><i>

		<p>How do people not make it to class when it snows?? I saw a homeless dude, riding a bike, wearing a trench coat... I don't get it.</p>

We were eating our breakfast, a pint of strawberry ice-cream. Nathan Shutts gets a text from a girl he met the night before saying that "Hey that Tommy Gaessler kid just won an award!" She was at the ceremony, and Mason and I ran down to the massive room where it was being held! I walked up the center isle and received my award with a pint of ice-cream in my left hand. I got the excellence in photo portfolio award! It was a second place award out of hundreds, maybe thousands of submissions.</p>

		<p>After working on this project since spring break, I am ready to go to bed. Its 1:49 am, and the perfectionist part of me says keep working, but perfection can't be achieved. 2,618 lines of code later I created something great. This sums up my life while at Regis and how I grew into the man I am today. I am ready for the next stage in my life, bring it on world!</p>
